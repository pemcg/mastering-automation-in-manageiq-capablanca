== Creating a Service Catalog Item

In this chapter we'll go through the steps involved in creating a service catalog item to provision a virtual machine into Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV). We'll create a service dialog that allows the user to specify a name for both the new virtual machine and the service, and specify the number of CPUs and memory size of the provisioned virtual machine from a drop-down list.

[NOTE]
Although for this example we'll be provisioning into RHEV, the same procedure can be used to create a service catalog item to provision into other providers.

=== The Service Dialog

We're going to create a service dialog to prompt for the number of CPUs, and the amount of memory for the new virtual machine. These two characteristics will be added to the provisioning task object for the new VM, and we know that such items are stored in the task object's options hash for a provisioning operation. The _CatalogItemInitialization_ state machine can handle the insertion of our dialog values into the options hash for us, as long as we name our dialog elements correctly.

==== Finding the Correct Element Names

We saw from <<catalogitembundleinitialization>> that _CatalogItemInitialization_ recognises and special-cases some element names, including *vm_name* and **service_name**, so we can create two of our elements with these names. If this is all we wish to prompt for, then we can move straight on to creating the service dialog.

For our use case however, we are also prompting for number of CPUs, and memory size. Any service dialog fields that we create with the intention of altering the final VM configuration (such as number of CPUs, or memory size), must also be named in a particular way. The element name must match the key in the provisioning task's options hash that we wish to overwrite.

We can find this key name in either of two ways; by examining the YAML code that makes up the provisioning dialog, or by performing an interactive provision of a virtual machine and examining the provisioning task's options hash during the provisioning process.

===== Searching the Provisioning Dialog

The simplest way to search the provisioning dialogs is to copy the appropriate one, edit, then select and paste the contents to a flat file that can be grepped, i.e.

....
grep -i "memory\|cpu\|core\|socket" miq_provision_redhat_dialogs_template.yaml
      :number_of_sockets:
        :description: Number of Sockets
      :cores_per_socket:
        :description: Cores per Socket
      :vm_memory:
        :description: Memory (MB)
....

This shows that we probably need to name our elements _cores_per_socket_ and _vm_memory_.

===== Examining the options hash during provisioning

As an alternative (or confirmation) to finding the key names from the provisioning dialog, we can use one of the techniques that we learnt in <<investigative-debugging>> to dump the contents of the provisioning task's options hash during a normal interactive provision. Here is an example of calling _object_walker_ after the *PostProvision* stage in the _VMProvision_VM/template_ state machine (see <<c33i1>>).

[[c33i1]]
.State added to the VM provisioning state machine to run ObjectWalker
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot1hd.png[]

Using the _object_walker_reader_ after we've provisioned a virtual machine, we see that the same values are in the miq_provision task's options hash:

....
object_walker_reader.rb | grep 'miq_provision' | grep "memory\|cpu\|core\|socket"
     |    $evm.root['miq_provision'].options[:cores_per_socket] = [1, "1"]
     |    $evm.root['miq_provision'].options[:memory_reserve] = nil
     |    $evm.root['miq_provision'].options[:number_of_sockets] = [1, "1"] 
     |    $evm.root['miq_provision'].options[:vm_memory] = ["1024", "1024"]  
....

===== Some commonly used element names

The following table lists some commonly used element names for typical VM characteristics that can be modified from a service dialog:

[cols="^,^",options="header",]
|=======================================================
|VM characteristic to be modified |Element name
|VM Name |vm_name
|Number of CPUs |cores_per_socket &/or number_of_sockets
|VM Memory |vm_memory
|Root Password |root_password
|MAC Address (first NIC) |mac_address
|IP Address (first NIC) |ip_addr
|OpenStack Flavor |instance_type
|=======================================================

[NOTE]
====
Any of the options hash values that set a parameter inside the virtual machine's operating system (such as *root_password* or *ip_addr*) need a mechanism to inject these parameters into the VM once it's booted. We typically do this using a VMware customization specification in conjunction with VMware tools, or cloud-init.

We can define a template cloud-init script that contains substitution variables (from *Infrastructure -> PXE* in the WebUI). Our value from +options[:root_password]+ will be substituted into a cloned version of this script at run-time, and used when cloud_init is executed in the guest.

....
...
<% root_password = evm[:root_password] %>
chpasswd:
    list: |
        root:<%=root_password%>
    expire: False
...
....

==== Creating the Service Dialog

We know from the preceding investigation that we must name our service dialog elements: **vm_name**, **service_name**, *option_0_cores_per_socket* and **option_0_vm_memory**.

We'll create a new service dialog called _RHEL7 VM_. Our new service dialog will be similar to the example that we created in <<working-with-virtual-machines>>, but this time we'll create two boxes: **Service and VM Names**, and **VM Characteristics**, each containing two elements (see <<c33i2>>).

[[c33i2]]

The *Service Name* and *VM Name* elements in the first box are both of type **Text Box**, and have the names *service_name* and *vm_name* respectively.

The *Number of CPUs* element in the second box is of type **Drop Down List** (see <<c33i3>>).

[[c33i3]]
.Number of CPUs element
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot3hd.png[Screenshot,400,align="center"]

We'll populate the list with options to provision one, two or four CPUs (see <<c33i4>>).

The *VM Memory* element in the second box is of type **Drop Down List** (see <<c33i5>>).

[[c33i5]]

=== Creating the Service Catalog Item

We need to create a service catalog item, but we'll also create a new _service catalog_ to put the item into.

==== Create a Catalog

The first thing we should do is create a service catalog to store the service item. We can have many catalogs; they are used to organise or categorise our service items and bundles.

Navigate to the *Catalogs* section in the accordion, and select *Configuration -> Add a New Catalog* (see <<c33i7>>).

[[c33i7]]
.Adding a new catalog
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot7hd.png[Screenshot,620,align="center"]

Give the catalog a name (for this example we'll use "Generic Servers"), leave everything else as default, and click *Add*.

==== Creating the Catalog Item

Navigate to the *Catalog Items* section in the accordion, highlight the newly created *Generic Servers* catalog, then select *Configuration -> Add a New Catalog Item* (see <<c33i8>>).

[[c33i8]]
.Adding a new catalog item
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot8hd.png[Screenshot,700,align="center"]

Select *RHEV* from the *Catalog Item Type* drop-down list (see <<c33i9>>).

[[c33i9]]
.Selecting the catalog item type
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot9hd.png[Screenshot,400,align="center"]

Enter a name and description for the catalog item, and select the *Display in Catalog* check-box to expose the remaining fields to be filled in. Select our newly created *Generic Servers* catalog and *RHEL7 VM* dialog in the appropriate drop-downs. For the Provisioning Entry Point, navigate to _ManageIQ/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template/CatalogItemInitialization_ (see <<c33i10>>).

[[c33i10]]
.Completing the basic info tab
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot10hd.png[Screenshot,700,align="center"]

Click on the *Details* tab, and enter some HTML-formatted text to describe the catalog item to anyone viewing in the catalog:

[literal]
----
<h1>Generic RHEL 7 Server</h1>  
<hr>  
<p>This catalog item will deploy a <strong>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7</strong> 
server, built from the @Base package set, and patched to 01-March-2016. 

A selection of CPU count and memory size can be made when ordering</p> 
----


Click on the *Request Info* tab, and fill in the details. Select an appropriate template, and **Environment**, **Hardware**, *Network* tab settings that are known to work when a VM is provisioned interactively (see <<service-tips-and-tricks>>). The VM name will be overwritten during the provisioning process, so here we just set it as _changeme_ (see <<c33i11>>).

[[c33i11]]
.Completing the request info tab
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot11hd.png[Screenshot,670,align="center"]

Finally click the *Add* button.

Select a suitable sized icon for a custom image, and save.

=== Ordering the Catalog Item

Navigate to the *Service Catalogs* section in the accordion, expand the *Generic Servers* Catalog, and highlight the *Generic RHEL 7 Server (RHEV)* catalog item (see <<c33i12>>).

[[c33i12]]
.Navigating to the service catalog item
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot12hd.png[Screenshot,700,align="center"]

Click **Order**, and fill out the service dialog values (see <<c33i13>>).

[[c33i13]]
.Completing the service dialog
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot13hd.png[Screenshot,420,align="center"]

Click *Submit*

After a new minutes, the new service should be visible in *My Services*, containing the new VM (see <<c33i14>>).

[[c33i14]]
.The finished service
image::part3/chapter33/images/screenshot14hd.png[Screenshot,500,align="center"]

If we examine the details of the VM, we see that it has been created with our requested CPU count and memory size (see <<c33i15>>).

=== Summary

This example describes the procedure for creating a service catalog item to provision a single virtual machine. We can follow the same procedure to populate a service catalog with many types of virtual machine, both Windows and Linux. Although the service dialog used in this example was quite basic, it is typical of many generic services that we can create for our users. We can add further dialog elements, but we must be careful to balance the trade-off between simplicity of design and presenting additional choice to our users. Using dynamic elements can help in this regard. They enable us to create dialogs with "intelligent" elements that offer a reduced selection of choices, filtered by relevance for the requesting user. Rather than offering a drop-down list of all possible networks to provision the virtual machine onto for example, we might filter based on the requesting user's group membership, or based on the input from another dialog element indicating that the VM should be tagged as _Development_.
